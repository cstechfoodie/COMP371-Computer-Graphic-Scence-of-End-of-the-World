Hi I hope the file would directly run itself.

If not you may need to build the extensions, you can find the necessary instructions here:
https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window
The stuff needed are in Include and Libs

For rendering the models, I also imported assimp extensions, for more information, click this:

If you find it still not working, ask me, I'll try to solve the question with you.
